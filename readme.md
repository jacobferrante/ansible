# Ansible

This repo is dedicated to ansible playbook and files I will use for deployments on my personal machines, whether it be a server on AWS or my own personal computer to speed up the process of setting up a system.

## ubuntu_setup.yaml

This is a playbook dedicated to provisioning a AWS lightsail instance for testing and developement purposes. This will take a fresh instance and update/upgrade the existing software, install docker, jenkins and other tools to make sure deployments go smoothly and so I can start working right away on testing.
